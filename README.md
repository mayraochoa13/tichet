#### Get Started  
1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the Repository 
2. In root directory, install packages
```
npm install
```
3. Change directory to server
```
cd server
```
4. Run app.js 
```
nodemon app.js
```
5. Visit localhost, should ask you to log in  
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

#### Process 
1. After successfully cloning and running the ```app.js```: Make a new branch
```
git checkout -b implementing-new-feature
```

2. Stage changes, aka changes you want to save 
```
got add .
```
the ```add . ``` will stage all uncommited changes, sometimes you do not want to stage all changes so you can stage specific changes using vs code interface 

3. Make commits often 
```
git commit -m 'consise to the point message of your change' 
```
Make sure your commit messages are short but explain your changes well, it will make it easier for people to review your code. Commit often, you do not want to make a 1 commit with 20 changes but at the same time you don't want too many commits, its a balance and with practice reading other peoples prs youll get better at this !

4. Push your branch so we can all see it !
```
git push
```
Once you push, your terminal in vs code will prompt this message 
>To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
>
>  git push --set-upstream origin my-branch-name

You must then copy and paste that statement and run it next:
```
git push --set-upstream origin my-branch-name
```
5. Using the link generated by step 4, it will take you to your Pull Request (pr). In which you need to provide a description of what you did and add Reviewers. 

PLEASE DO NOT MERGE PULL REQUEST WITHOUT SOMEONE REVIEWING YOUR PR !!!!!!
